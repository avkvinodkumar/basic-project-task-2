**Fake News Detection**

**Description**

Fake news detection is a critical task in today's digital age. With the rapid spread of misinformation, it is essential to verify the legitimacy of information to prevent the harmful effects of misinformation. This project aims to combat the spread of fake news using Python, TfidfVectorizer, and PassiveAggressiveClassifier.

**Project Overview**

This project involves developing a machine learning model that can accurately detect fake news from real news articles. The model uses TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into a vector format and PassiveAggressiveClassifier to train and evaluate the model. The dataset used is FakeNewsNet, which contains 12,442 articles labeled as either "REAL" or "FAKE".

**Features**

* Detects fake news with high accuracy using TfidfVectorizer and PassiveAggressiveClassifier
* Supports real-time detection of fake news
* Easy to integrate with web applications or other platforms
* Can be extended to support multi-class classification (e.g., detecting different types of fake news)

**Files**

* `fake_news_detection.py`: Main script for training and evaluating the model
* `data`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the required libraries and dependencies
* `README.md`: This file

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/avkvinodkumar/fake-news-detection.git`
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python fake_news_detection.py`
